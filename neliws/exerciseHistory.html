                <p>
                    We reviewed the previous exercise and went over common mistakes.
                    We explored synchronization in Java, learning how to use locks effectively.
                    We also looked at wait and notify, working through a practical example of the producer-consumer
                    problem to understand why they are needed. Additionally, we briefly discussed Exercise 3. 
                    To finish, we solved some past exam questions.
